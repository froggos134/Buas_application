The goal is to collect as many colored balls within the limited time, 
to 'bring back the color' in the protagonists world. 
The player can do this by, of course collecting the colored balls, 
but only a fourth of the balls give color back to the screen. 
The other balls have a white outline. 
These are special, the blue one gives you a higher speed. 
The green one restores the players HP. 
And the red one has two functions: it obviously lowers the HP, 
but it also lowers the players speed!

play by using WASD to move the character
press escape to close the window.
